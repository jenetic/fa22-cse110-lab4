1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. The code returns an error saying that "ReferenceError: result is not defined". This is because `result` was defined in the `if` block using the `let` keyword and line 13 tried to access `result` outside of the `if` block. However, `result` only has block scope, so it can't be accessed outside of the block it was defined in.
5. The code returns an error saying "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.". This is because we tried to reassign `result` after declaring it the first time. It is a `const` variable so we cannot reassign values to it.
